    <p>Some notable places in the house are:
        <ul>
            <li>The gun locker, of which Jacob's dad took the key of.</li>
            <li>The bedroom, where Jacob finds more photos of the peculiar children.</li>
            <li>The forest, where Jacob finds his grandfather near death.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Jacob's grandfather often told Jacob many stories about the <a href="../Loop/home.html">peculiar children</a> and the <a href="golan.html">monsters</a>.</p>
    <p>Later, Jacob is called to Grandpa Portman's house, as 'the monsters are coming for him.' However, when Jacob gets there, the house is empty. In the woods behind the backyard, Jacob soon discovers his grandfather lying, almost dead. He also, for a split second, sees a hollowgast in the woods.</p><br>
    <p>After Jacob sees his father dead in the woods, he thinks he has Acute Stress Reaction because of <a href="golan.html">Dr. Golan</a>. He also has daily nightmares after seeing the hollowgast in <a href="jacobhome.html">Jacob's Home</a>.</p>
