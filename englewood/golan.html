    <h1>Dr. Golan's Office</h1>
    <p>After Jacob claims that he saw a monster kill his <a href="grandpahome.html">grandfather</a>, he is sent to therapy with Dr. Golan.</p>
    <p>Dr. Golan makes quick work of him, and makes Jacob believe that he actually has acute stress reaction and never actually saw the monster.</p>
    <p>Dr. Golan is a recurring character in the book and often lets Jacob get what he wants by convincing Jacob's parents that it's good for Jacob.</p>
    <p>Dr. Golan is finally revealed to be a wight at the end of the book and eventually captures Miss Peregrine and Miss Avocet, going to <a href="../Loop/harbor.html">Cairnholm's lighthouse</a> to give the ymbrynes to other wights. After this, Jacob shoots Dr. Golan.</p>
    <p><a href="englewood.html">Back to Englewood</a></p><br>
    <p>Dr. Golan gives Jacob the impression that everything he saw at <a href="grandpahome.html">Abraham's home</a> was fake. Dr. Golan says he has acute stress reaction, which leads Jacob into believing that everything was generated by his own mind. This leads to Jacob still feeling unhappy and worried.</p>
