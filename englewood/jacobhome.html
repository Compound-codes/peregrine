    <h1>Jacob's Home</h1>
    <p>Jacob's home is located in <a href="englewood.html">Englewood, Florida.</a> It is an intricate house, and his mother often has parties there. Many of his relatives live near him, most notably his grandfather, Abraham Portman. After Jacob sees the Hollowgast at <a href="grandpahome.html">his Grandfather's home</a>, he often stays in his room playing computer games because he is scared of going outside. Jacob's birthday party is located here, and his aunt gives him a book from his grandfather.  This book includes a letter addressed to Grandpa Portman from Miss Peregrine. The letter allows Jacob to further decipher his grandpa's last words which later leads him to <a href="../Cairnholm/cairnholm.html">Cairnholm.</a>
    </p><br>
    <p>In his home, Jacob is often scared and has anxiety. He has nightmares and doesn't go outside. He has frequent anxiety about his grandfather and the nightmares are daily. Before he saw the hollowgast, Jacob often felt isolated because he had only one friend (Ricky) who was had the personality of a bully. He also worked at a job he did not like.</p>
