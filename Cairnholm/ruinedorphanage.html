    <p>The home was destroyed and Jacob describes it as the "nightmare house." Jacob visits the broken down house in the present. The first time he visits, he quickly leaves. The second time, he goes and explores the house in full and also visits the nearby bog and <a href="cairn.html">nearby cairn</a>.</p>
