    <p>In <a href="cairnholm.html">Cairnholm</a>, Abraham Portman stayed in an orphanage as a child. After the bombing of the island on September 3, 1940, the orphange was destroyed and was never the same again.</p>

    <p>The home was destroyed and Jacob describes it as the "nightmare house." Jacob visits the broken down house in the present. The first time he visits, he quickly leaves. The second time, he goes and explores the house in full and also visits the nearby bog and <a href="cairn.html">nearby cairn</a>.</p><br>
    <p>Jacob has strong emotional ties to the broken-down orphanage. When he enters the house, he has an emotional breakdown and feels bad for the rough life that his grandfather had. He also experiences fear and anxiety that anything might happen when he is in the ruined house.</p><br>
    <p>On page 108, the book says, "I couldn't stop myself, so I thought about all the bad things and I fed it and fed it until I was crying so hard I had to gasp for breath between sobs." The quote highlights the emotional breakdown and how Jacob felt for his grandfather once he entered the orphanage.</p>
