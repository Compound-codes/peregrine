    <h1>The Priest Hole</h1>
    <p>The priest hole is a hotel in <a href="cairnholm.html">Cairnholm</a> where Jacob and his father stayed. Jacob snuck out occasionally to the <a href="cairn.html">cairn</a> to see his friends in the loop. </p>

        <!-- from the movie -->
    </div>
    <p>Jacob's father usually stays up at the priest hole working on his book and drinking the beer. The food there is mediocre at best. Once Jacob's father notices an "ornithologist" who is a wight he gives up on his book.</p>
    <p>At the hotel, the "ornithologist" wight visits and asks for some food. He also watches Jacob outside the priest hole.</p><br>
    <p>In the Priest Hole, Jacob talks with his father and learns more about his grandfather. Jacob's father accuses Abraham Portman of cheating on his wife, which causes Jacob to feel frustrated and that he needed to find more answers about his grandfather his past and regarding Emma's letters.</p><br>
    <p>"It was true, of course, what my dad had said: I did worship my grandfather. There were things about him that I needed to be true, and being an adulterer was not one of them" (Riggs 92).</p>
