    <p>After Jacob gets guided by Dr. Golan in <a href="../englewood/englewood.html">Englewood</a> to learn more about his grandfather and find Miss Peregrine and the children. His father and him stay in the only rooms in Cairnholm called the <a href="priesthole.html">Priest Hole</a>. Once he gets to the island however, he learns that there was a bombing that destroyed the house and killed the children. After learning this, he gets directions from Martin's uncle Oggie.</p>
    <p>After getting directions, Jacob goes with two people named Worm and Dylan (also known as Dirty D). They lead him to a sheep stable, then refuse to go further. Jacob goes to an <a href="ruinedorphanage.html">old, scarred, and broken down house</a> instead of the "magic house" that his grandfather always described.</p>
    <p>Near the house, there was a bog. In the bog, there was a <a href="cairn.html">cairn</a> where he wandered into a very different place.</p>
