    <h1>The Harbor</h1>
    <p>The harbor in the <a href="loop.html">loop</a> is used in two significant parts of the story.</p>
    <p>First, Emma takes Jacob to the harbor to teach him about the hollowgasts. Jacob then realizes he is also a peculiar in that moment, understanding that he can see the hollows.</p>
    <p>The second event that takes place in the harbor is when the children find Dr. Golan at the lighthouse. Jacob, Millard, Bronwyn, and Emma go to fight Dr. Golan, and after Millard gets shot so that Bronwyn has to stay back for him, Jacob and Emma go up the lighthouse. The duo eventually meet the wight and Dr. Golan throws the ymbrynes off into the water. Jacob then gathers the willpower to shoot Dr. Golan there.</p>

    <p>In the harbor, Jacob talks with Emma and kisses her. This causes him to feel like he has friends and it causes him to feel loved. He also experiences emotional growth in the harbor when he shoots Dr. Golan, as it represents that he is showing emotional growth from being sheltered to having courage.</p><br>
    <p>"[Dr. Golan] laughed. 'You couldn't fire a gun if you wanted to. You forget, I'm intimately familiar with your poor, fragile psyche. It'd give you nightmares'" (Riggs 324). This quote represents Jacob before he shot Doctor Golan, showing he progressed in the harbor morally and mentally.</p>
